# ESPC Stories
interface for creating a sensory story experience with Adafruit HUZZAH and Raspberry Pi

a therapist can press a button to activate various usb devices like fans and lights

the project is built off the MQTT Mosquitto broker developed by Eclipse: https://mosquitto.org/.

a static IP address will make communication between the Huzzah and Pi much easier.  This can be done by modifying the dhcpd.conf file here: https://www.modmypi.com/blog/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update and the tweaks described here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=111709
